				  ExpectCare Hospice supports people in Jefferson County, Alabama and surrounding areas while enabling them to live fully, with comfort and dignity, to the end of life. Our family provides physical, emotional and spiritual support for people faced with life-limiting illness as well as their caregivers and families.
                  “If only we had called you sooner…” is often heard from families who have been served by our staff. We have a team of skilled professionals and volunteers to serve our patients and their families, whether in the comfort of their own homes, in assisted living centers, in skilled nursing facilities or in hospitals.

				  A Legacy of Service
                </h2>
				<p>
				  Whether their story is one of facing life-limiting illness or coping with the loss of a loved one, each is unique. However, the common thread that runs through them all is how compassion and care can help transform life’s most trying times into a journey of comfort, peace and dignity.

					3 Easy Ways to Refer: Phone, Fax or On-line
						 </h2>
						<p>
							While a physician’s order is required to admit a patient to hospice or palliative care, anyone can make a referral, including friends or family. If someone you know is living with a life-limiting illness and might benefit from our services, we welcome your call, your fax or online inquiry.
		          To begin the referral process, whether the patient needs in-home care, care in an assisted living or nursing home facility, simply contact the ExpectCare Hospice office and our staff will provide you with the assistance you require.
		          Our staff can provide information about hospice care and can help you determine whether these options might be the right choice. ExpectCare Hospice will then work with the patient’s doctor for certification into our program.
		          At ExpectCare Hospice, we are committed to quality end-of-life care. You expect care, and we will provide you and your family quality end-of-life care and support.
